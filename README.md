Pagination refers to the process of dividing content into separate pages, especially in documents or websites where large amounts of information need to be organized for easier reading or navigation. Pagination typically involves breaking content into discrete sections or chunks and displaying them on different pages.

In printed documents or books, pagination involves assigning sequential numbers to pages for reference and navigation. For example, you might see page numbers at the bottom or top of each page.

On websites or digital documents, pagination often includes features like next page and previous page buttons or links, as well as page number indicators, allowing users to navigate through content efficiently.

Pagination helps manage the presentation of content, making it more manageable and accessible to users, especially when dealing with large datasets or lengthy documents. It also facilitates quicker access to specific sections of content, enhancing the user experience.
